        <p>It is perhaps fair to say that volunteering conjures up feelings of helping those in need or taking time out of your own life to give back to society, family or friends. However, what often goes unspoken is that to many, volunteering means unpaid labour. The lines have been blurred in recent years with graduates forced to do endless apprenticeships and internships for 'experience', but many corporations are just using those desperate to work in certain fields for free graft, because grubby students will fall for anything after all.

            It feels that there is a certain stigma attached to the word volunteering among some people. As much as we probably hate to admit it, the word doesn't evoke much excitement and truthfully, many people are put off by it. In turbulent times, there is a tend to lean more towards safe guarding our own wellbeing, but whatever the negative connotations, volunteering benefits absolutely everyone involved.
            
            If you're thinking of a new hobby or just dusting off the yoga mat to start up an old one, have a think about whether you'd like to volunteer. The selfless deed of volunteering is the first great reason to be excited about it. Secondly, it has been proven to help people meet new friends, combat anxiety and depression, stimulate your mind and even advance your career. You never know what you're going to get out of volunteering, and the best thing about it is that it's entirely within your own control. You can decide how much or how little you do. In a world where Tinder lets you pick and choose people at break neck speed, maybe taking a step back into real life to make some organic connections is what you're after. Perhaps that nagging voice of wanting to snap at your boss and or children is getting even louder and you want a positive way to release stress, volunteering could be the thing to clear your head.
            
            Volunteering is also an ideal avenue to practice and improve relationship skills, be it personal or professional. You'll discover that regularly meeting with people with similar interests and beliefs will lead to easier conversations about shared interests, or possibly pet peeves depending on your attachment to that person! There is also much to be said about volunteering as a family, showing your kids how rewarding it is to give back to people and a community will improve their mental health and outlook on life. Or, maybe you need to get your partner off the sofa and into something mindfully stimulating more often.
            
            Whatever your reason, there is no negative aspect of volunteering. Use your spare time to improve your life and the lives of others, meet new people and boost your mental health.</p>
