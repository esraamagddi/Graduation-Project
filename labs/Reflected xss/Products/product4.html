        <h2 class="text-primary">The Do's & Don'ts of Writing Your Resume</h2>
        <p><span id="blog-author">Stu Pot | 11 March 2023</p><hr class="text-primary">
        <p>We all know how extremely important first impressions are, especially in the business world. Your resume is your handshake to your future employer, don't make it a sweaty limp one.
          The first thing to remember is don't try and be funny in your job descriptions. If you've been working with children the employer doesn't want to read 'could have given them a smack most days, but loved them really'. They will think it only a matter of time before you reach breaking point and this could become a reality.
          Swearing is usually frowned upon. Just because you've seen all those memes on facebook stating that people who swear have the highest intelligence doesn't mean it's true, or that you should use bad language in your profile.
          If you are presenting a hard copy of your resume at interview your future boss doesn't want to see what you had for breakfast. It is quite possible they have allergies, or could be vegan, and that little bit of bacon fat stuck to your educational history could really put them off you.
          Don't include anything you can't live up to. Applying to become a ski instructor when you can't ski could be problematic, and quite a bit dangerous. Imagine being put to the test at an interview of everything you have listed as a skill, if you can't do it don't include it. Picture everyone's embarrassment when you have stated you can 'do it blindfolded' and you knock over the 15th-century porcelain vase containing the interviewer's mother's ashes.
          It is not enough to just give your previous job title, it is important to give a short description of your duties. The job description might suggest the company is 'laid back', and they 'enjoy the camaraderie of team spirit', but this does not mean you describe how you were the one who always photocopied your fanny at the Christmas party. Keep it specific to what you were paid for. That does not include adding all the boozy lunches you had with clients on expenses, or how you used company funds to take them on to a lap dancing club. This is NOT what they mean by laid back or camaraderie.
          Ask yourself, would you employ you? If the answer is yes then you probably need to rewrite your resume until it reads like someone you wouldn't employ.
