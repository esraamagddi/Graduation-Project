        <p><span id="blog-author">Fred Time | 27 February 2023</p><hr class="text-primary">
        <p>I remember the first time I told a lie. That's not to say I didn't do it before then, I just don't remember. I was nine years old and at my third school already. Fitting into already established friendship groups was hard. So on that dreaded Monday morning when we had to sit and write about what we did over the weekend I made up a great big fat lie in the hope of making myself an interesting person. I told the class the window cleaner had fallen off his ladder. This is when I learned lies don't get you anywhere. Nobody liked me any the more for it, it did not dramatically transform my world into a better one.
          I have a book on my desk called 'Lying', my son suggested I read it as telling lies has always been a big topic of conversation. The types of lies we tell. He insists that even though I don't think I tell lies, I get creative with the truth. Should someone call I don't want to speak to, but for some reason, the phone must be answered? I will tell him to say I'm in the bath. I will then go and stand in the bath so that I am at ease with my conscience. I have not told a lie, I am in the bath.
          People always say it's OK to tell 'little white lies', if it is in the best interest of the person being little-white-lied to. Recently I mentioned to an (almost) total stranger that I had lost 14lbs in weight. He replied, 'I thought you had, I noticed that.' When I got all excited and started pulling my stomach in and preening myself he added, 'I didn't really, I just know the right things to say.' I ask you, what kind of perverse lie is that?
          In society we grade our lies; the little white one, a great big fat one, a fib (equal to the little white lie) but all lies have consequences. Imagine if it had turned out that someone in my class knew my window cleaner, saw him up a ladder on the way home from school and called up to ask if he was OK after his fall. He could have been startled, dropped his bucket on the child and have proceeded to actually fall off his ladder. In my fantasies, it would have been the most popular girl with the long blonde hair who got hit by the bucket. I'm sure she was lovely really.
          You know the biggest question of all time, 'does my butt look big in this?' In an effort to be kind, and not get a punch on the nose, the answer is nearly always, 'no.' My favorite response has to be, 'your butt doesn't look big in just 'this', it looks big in everything because you have a big butt.' I think there would be a small number of people who could get away with that. But if you tell someone their butt doesn't look big, but it really does, how are you helping them? What if as a result of that lie they book a long-haul flight but aren't aware they need a larger than the standard seat to accommodate that big butt? They arrive at Disneyland, Florida, spend 3 hours queuing for a ride their butt is too large to sit in, all that waiting for nothing. Holiday ruined.
          In conclusion, I suggest you think twice before telling a lie of any size. Because contrary to belief, size does really matter.
