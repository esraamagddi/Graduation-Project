                     <p class="  fs-5  ms-3  align-items-center fw-semibold"> Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the https://Securespace .com website, including accessing the public and paid content of the website (the "Service") operated by Securespace ("us", "we", or "our"). <br> <br>

                        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service. <br> <br>
                        
                        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms then you do not have permission to access the Service. <br> <br>
                        
                        Subscriptions <br> <br>
                        
                        Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. <br> <br>
                        
                        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Securespace cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Securespace customer support team. The cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. <br> <br>
                        
                        A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Securespace with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, country, zip code, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you authorise Securespace to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to the payment method you provided. <br> <br>
                        
                        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Securespace will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. <br> <br>
                           
                        Fee Changes <br> <br>
                        
                        Securespace, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. <br> <br>
                        
                        Securespace will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. <br> <br>
                        
                        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. <br> <br>
                        
                        Refunds <br> <br>
                        
                        Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Securespace on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of Securespace and in compliance with Australian consumer Law. <br> <br>
                        
                        Accounts <br> <br>

                        Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Securespace. <br> <br>

                        You acknowledge and agree that Securespace shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third party web sites or services. <br> <br>
                        
                        We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third party web sites or services that you visit. <br> <br>
                        
                        Termination <br> <br>
                        
                        We may terminate or suspend your account and/or bar access to the Service immediately, upon your material breach of these Terms or another executed agreement between the parties hereto; where such breach, being capable of being cured, has not been cured within a reasonable timeframe. <br> <br>
                        
                        If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service, and in such case you may continue to use the Subscription until the end of the remaining billing period. <br> <br>
                        
                        All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, intellectual property provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. <br> <br>
                        
                        Limitation Of Liability <br> <br>
                        
                        To the extent permitted by law, Securespace, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal claim, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. <br> <br>
                        
                        Where Securespace is liable for any loss or damage, the liability is limited to the value of one billing cycle of the relevant Subscription. <br> <br>
                        
                        Content <br> <br>
