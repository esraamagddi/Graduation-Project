                        Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Securespaceâ€™s legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described in this Privacy Policy depends on the types of Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collected them. <br> <br>
                        
                        Securespace may process your Personal Data because: <br> <br>
                        
                        We need to perform a contract with you
                        You have given us permission to do so
                        The processing is in our legitimate interests and it's not overridden by your rights
                        For payment processing purposes
                        To comply with the law
                        Retention of Data
                        Securespace will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. <br> <br>
                        
                        Securespace will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or when we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods. <br> <br>
                        
                        Transfer Of Data <br> <br>
                        
                        If you are located outside Australia and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to Australia and process it there. <br> <br>
                        
                        By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you agree to the transfer of your Personal Data to Australia for the purposes of processing by Securespace. <br> <br>

                        Securespace will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is stored securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organisation unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your Personal Data. If we need to transfer your Personal Data to an overseas recipient, we will ensure that that the recipient of the information is bound by law or a binding scheme that is at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles. <br> <br>
                        
                        Disclosure Of Data

                        If Securespace is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. <br> <br>
                        
                        Disclosure for Law Enforcement <br> <br>
                        
                        Under certain circumstances, Securespace may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency). <br> <br>
                        
                        Legal Requirements <br> <br>
                        
                        Securespace may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: <br> <br>
                        
                        To comply with a legal obligation
                        To establish, exercise or defend the rights or property of Securespace , or any legal or equitable claims
                        To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
                        To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public or to locate missing persons.
                        Security Of Data and Data Breach
                        The security of your data is important to us. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data is protected from misuse, interference, or loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. <br> <br>
                        
                        However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br> <br>
                        
                        In the event of a Personal Data breach, we will endeavour to notify you of the breach without undue delay, unless the Personal Data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. <br> <br>
                        
                        "Do Not Track" Signals

                        Payments
                        We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors). <br> <br>
                        
                        We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information. <br> <br>
                        
                        The payment processors we work with are: <br> <br>
                        
                        Stripe <br> <br>
                        
                        Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy <br> <br>
                        
                        PayPal or Braintree
                        Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full <br> <br>
                        
                        Links To Other Sites
                        Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. <br> <br>
                        
                        We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services. <br> <br>
                        
                        Children's Privacy
                        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). <br> <br>
                        
                        We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. <br> <br>
